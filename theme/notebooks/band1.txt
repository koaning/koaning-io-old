i talk to you every now and then
i never felt so alone again
i stop to think at a wishing well
my thoughts send me on a carousel
here i am standing on my own
not a motion from the telephone
i know not a reason why
solitudes a reason to die
just you wait and see
as school life is a
it is a woken dream
arent you feeling alone
i guess its just another
i guess its just another
i guess its just another night alone
now as i walk down the street
i need a job just to sleep in sheets
buying food every once in a while
but not enough to purchase a smile
a tank of gas is a treasure to me
i know now that nothing is free
i talk to you every now and then
i never felt so alone again
just you wait and see
as school life is a
it is a woken dream
arent you feeling alone
i guess its just another
i guess its just another
i guess its just another night alone
you and i should get away for awhile
i just want to be alone with your smile
buy some candy and cigarettes and well get in my car
well blast the stereo and well drive to madagascar
because when im with you theres nothing i wouldnt do
i just want to be your only one
im grasping out at straws thinking back to what i saw
that night on the floor when we were all alone
my love life was getting so bland
there are only so many ways i can make love with my hand
sometimes it makes me want to laugh
sometimes i want to take my toaster in the bath
because when im with you theres nothing i wouldnt do
i just want to be your only one
im grasping out at straws thinking back to what i saw
that night on the floor when we were all alone
whos gonna be the odd man out
i dont want to be the odd man out
is this going to be the end
or are you going to be my new girlfriend
its alright to tell me what you think about me
i wont try to argue or hold it against you
i know that youre leaving you must have your reasons
the season is calling and your pictures are falling down
the steps that i retrace the sad look on your face
the timing and structure did you hear he fucked her
a day late a buck short im writing the report
on losing and failing when i move im flailing now
and its happened once again
ill turn to a friend
someone that understands
sees through the master plan
but everybodys gone
and ive been here for too long
to face this on my own
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
and maybe ill see you at a movie sneak preview
youll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
and ill smile and youll wave well pretend its okay
the charade it wont last when hes gone i wont come back
and itll happen once again
youll turn to a friend
someone that understands
and sees through the master plan
but everybodys gone
and youve been there for too long
to face this on your own
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
yeah my girlfriend takes me home when im too drunk to drive
and she doesnt get all jealous when i hang out with the guys
she laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
she brings me mexican food from sombreros just because
(yeah just because)
and my girlfriend likes u.l. and d.h.c.
and shes so smart and independent i dont think she needs me
quite half as much as i know i need her
i wonder why theres not another guy that shed prefer
and when i feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
i show up at 3 am
shes still up watching vacation and i
see her pretty face
it takes me away to a better place and
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
yeah my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
and it doesnt seem to matter that im lacking in the bulge
she laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
she brings me mexican food from sombreros just because
and when i feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
i show up at 3 am
shes still up watching vacation and i
see her pretty face
it takes me away to a better place and
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine

(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everythings gonna be fine
i took her out it was friday night
i wore cologne to get the feeling right
we started making out and she took off my pants
but then i turned on the tv
and thats about the time that she walked away from me
nobody likes you when youre 23
and are still more amused by tv shows
what the hell is a.d.d.
my friends say i should act my age
whats my age again
whats my age again
then later on on the drive home
i called her mom from a pay phone
i said i was the cops
and your husbands in jail
this state looks down on sodomy
and thats about the time that bitch hung up on me
nobody likes you when youre 23
and are still more amused by prank phone calls
what the hell is caller id
my friends say i should act my age
whats my age again
whats my age again
and thats about the time she walked away from me
nobody likes you when youre 23
and you still act like youre in freshman year
what the hell is wrong with me
my friends say i should act my age
whats my age again
whats my age again
thats about the time she broke up with me
no one should take themselves so seriously
with many years ahead to fall in line
why would you wish that on me
i never want to act my age
whats my age again
whats my age again
whats my age again
all the small things
true care truth brings
ill take one lift
your ride best trip
always i know
youll be at my show
watching waiting commiserating
say it aint so i will not go
turn the lights off carry me home
na na na na....
late night come home
work sucks i know
she left me roses by the stairs
surprises let me know she cares
say it aint so i will not go
turn the lights off carry me home
na na na na....
say it aint so i will not go
turn the lights off carry me home
keep your head still ill be your thrill
the night will go on my little windmill
say it aint so i will not go
turn the lights off carry me home
keep your head still ill be your thrill
the night will go on
the night will go on
my little windmill
i never thought id die alone
i laughed the loudest whod have known
i trace the cord back to the wall
no wonder it was never plugged in at all
i took my time i hurried up
the choice was mine i didnt think enough
im too depressed to go on
youll be sorry when im gone
i never conquered rarely came
16 just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldnt wait to get outside
the world was wide too late to try
the tour was over wed survived
i couldnt wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never thought id die alone
another six months ill be unknown
give all my things to all my friends
youll never step foot in my room again
youll close it off board it up
remember the time that i spilled the cup
of apple juice in the hall
please tell mom this is not her fault
i never conquered rarely came
16 just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldnt wait to get outside
the world was wide too late to try
the tour was over wed survived
i couldnt wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never conquered rarely came
tomorrow holds such better days
days when i can still feel alive
when i cant wait to get outside
the world is wide the time goes by
the tour is over ive survived
i cant wait till i get home
to pass the time in my room alone
so sorry its over
so sorry its over
theres so much more that i wanted and (so sorry its over)
theres so much more that i needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry its over)
soon well all be gone
lets take some time to talk this over
youre outta line and rarely sober
we cant depend on your excuses
because in the end its fucking useless
you can only lean on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin out on a ledge begged you to come down
you can only lean on me for so long
i remember shots without a chaser
absent minded thoughts now youre a stranger
cover up the scars put on your game face
left you in a bar to try and save face
you can only lean on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin out on a ledge begged you to come down
you can only lean on me for so long
so sorry its over
so sorry its over
theres so much more that i wanted and (so sorry its over)
theres so much more that i needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry its over)
soon well all be gone
man on a mission
cant say i miss him around
insider information
hand in your resignation
loss of a good friend
best of intentions i found
tight lipped procrastination
ya later... see you around
hanging out behind the club on the weekend
acting stupid getting drunk with my best friends
i couldnt wait for the summer and the warped tour
i remember its the first time that i saw her there
shes getting kicked out of school cause shes failing
im kind of nervous cause i think all her friends hate me
shes the one shell always be there
she took my hand and that made it i swear
because i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what" and i told her that i didnt know
shes so cool im gonna sneak in through her window
everythings better when shes around
i cant wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
when we said we were gonna move to vegas
i remember the look her mother gave us
seventeen without a purpose or direction
we dont owe anyone a fucking explanation
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what" and i told her that i didnt know
shes so cool im gonna sneak in through her window
everythings better when shes around
i cant wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
black and white picture of her on my wall
i waited for her call
she always kept me waiting
and if i ever got another chance
id still ask her to dance
because she kept me waiting
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what" and i told her that i didnt know
shes so cool im gonna sneak in through her window
everythings better when shes around
i cant wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
with the girl at the rock show
with the girl at the rock show
(ill never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(ill never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(ill never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(ill never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(ill never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
in the car i just cant wait
to pick you up on our very first date
is it cool if i hold your hand
is it wrong if i think its lame to dance
do you like my stupid hair
would you guess that i didnt know what to wear
im just scared of what you think
you make me nervous so i really cant eat
lets go
dont wait
this nights almost over
honest lets make
this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
when you smile i melt inside
im not worthy for a minute of your time
i really wish it was only me and you
im jealous of everybody in the room
please dont look at me with those eyes
please dont hint that youre capable of lies
i dread the thought of our very first kiss
a target that im probably gonna miss
lets go
dont wait
this nights almost over
honest lets make
this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
lets go
dont wait
this nights almost over
honest lets make
this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
its hard to wake up
when the shades have been pulled shut
this house is haunted
its so pathetic
it makes no sense at all
im ripe with things to say
the words rot and fall away
what stupid poem could fix this home
id read it every day
so heres your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when youre dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
its not right
their anger hurts my ears
been running strong for seven years
rather than fix the problems
they never solve them
it makes no sense at all
i see them everyday
we get along so why cant they
if this is what he wants
and this is what she wants
then why is there so much pain
so heres your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when youre dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
its not right
so heres your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when youre dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
its not right
its not right
its not right
its not right
i got no regret right now (im feeling this)
the air is so cold and low (im feeling this)
let me go in her room (im feeling this)
i wanna take off her clothes (im feeling this)
show me the way to bed (im feeling this)
show me the way you move (im feeling this)
fuck it its such a blur (im feeling this)
i love all the things you do (im feeling this)
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna
where do we go from here
turn all the lights down now
smiling from ear to ear (im feeling this)
our breathing has got too loud (im feeling this)
show me the bedroom floor (im feeling this)
show me the bathroom mirror (im feeling this)
were taking this way too slow (im feeling this)
take me away from here (im feeling this)
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna
(fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna)
this place was never the same again after you came and went
how can you say you meant anything different
to anyone standing alone on the street
with a cigarette on the first night we met
look to the past and remember her smile
and maybe tonight i can breathe for awhile
im not in this scene i think im falling asleep
but then all that it needs is ill always be dreaming of you
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine)
ill leave when i wanna (ill leave when i wanna)
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer) (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine)
ill leave when i wanna (ill leave when i wanna) (so lost and disillusioned)
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time) (are we alone do you feel it)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer) (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine) (are we alone do you feel it)
ill leave when i wanna (ill leave when i wanna) (so lost and disillusioned)
fate fell short this time (are we alone do you feel it)
your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (are we alone do you feel it)
ill leave when i wanna (so lost and disillusioned)
hello there the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
we can live like jack and sally if we want
where you can always find me
well have halloween on christmas
and in the night well wish this never ends
well wish this never ends
(i miss you miss you)
(i miss you miss you)
where are you and im so sorry
i cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight
i need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as i stared i counted
webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
dont waste your time on me youre already
the voice inside my head (i miss you miss you)
(i miss you miss you)
(i miss you miss you)
(i miss you miss you)
(i miss you miss you)
the drops of rain they fall all over
this awkward silence makes me crazy
the glow inside burns light upon her
ill try to kiss you if you let me
(this cant be the end)
tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now i need you so bad
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down

your vows of silence fall all over
the look in your eyes makes me crazy
i feel the darkness break upon her
ill take you over if you let me
(you did this)
tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now i need you so bad
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down 
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)

another girl is loving you now
another planet forever holding you down
