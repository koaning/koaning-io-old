complete the motion if you stumble
go ask the dust for any answers

so smart she's leading me to ozone

use two sticks to make it in the nature

the gender of a generation
the birth of every other nation
worth your weight the gold of meditation
this chapter's going to be a close one
smoke rings i know your going to blow one
all on a spaceship persevering
use my hands for everything but steering

mop tops are happy when they feed you
j butterfly is in the treetop
birds that blow the meaning into bebop

win or lose just like you
far more shocking
than anything i ever knew
how about you
10 more reasons
why i need somebody new just like you

sweet talk but don't intimidate her
can't stop the gods from engineering
feel no need for any interfering
your image in the dictionary

deep kick	
i started when we were little kids free
spirits but already tormented by our own hands
given to us by our parents
we got together and wrote on desks
a slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
a slipped through whatever cracks
we can find minds altered
we didn¹t falter in portraving hysterical
and tragic characters
in a smog filled universe
we loved the dirty city
and the journeys away
from it we had not yet been
or seen our friends selves
chase tails round and round in
downward spiral leaving trail
of irretrievable vital life juice
behind still the brothers blood
comrades partner family
cuzz was impenetrable
and we lived inside it laughing
with no clother and everything
experimental œtill death was upon us
in our face mortality
and lots of things seemed futile
then but love and music can save us
and did while the giant grey monster grew
more poisoned and spewing ugly shit around
nothing is the same so we keep moving
went off and off and got some hair cuts
lookin wild and got all drugged up
hopped a train into the night
got a ride with a transvestite
two boys in san francisco
two boys in san francisco
blasted off in a bart bathroom
those coppers woke us up
mothersfuckers woke us up
two young brothers on a hover craft
telepathetic love and bellylaughs
storm the stage of universal
slim shine talk boy go subversal
papa¹s proud and so he sent us
pounding hearts full and relentless
two boys in london, england
two boys in london, england
climbing out of hostel windows
wearing gear so out but in though
come on kind and do the no no
two young brothers on a hovercraft
telepathics love and belly laughs
we went to fairfax high school
jumped off buildings into their pools
we¹d sit down and grease at canters
run like hell they can¹t catch us
two boys in la proper
two boys in la proper
stealin¹ anything that we could
gotta sneak into the starwood
gotta peak into the deep good
i remember 10 years ago
in hollywood we did some good
and we did some real bad stuff
but the butthole surfers
always said it¹s better to regret
something you did than something you didn¹t do
we were young and we were looking for the deep kick

you could do it in the city
you could do it in a zone
you could do it in a desert
you could do the unknown

moving slow in my lowest gear

you could do it with a stroll
you could do it with a stride
you could do it all alone
